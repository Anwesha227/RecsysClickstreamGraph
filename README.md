# RecsysClickstreamGraph


This case study involves the creation of a product recommender system based on user behavior graphs generated from clickstream data on an e-commerce platform.
Here is a broad overview of the steps involved :
  - Exploring the data and gaining insights.
  - Creating different types of co-occurrence graphs (combinations of weighted/unweighted, directed/undirected) from clickstream data for events such as views, purchases and cart additions.
  - Generating embeddings for the graphs using various algorithms such as node2vec and deepwalk.
  - Finally analyzing the embeddings obtained and using those to perform approximate nearest neighbor (FAISS) based recommendations.
